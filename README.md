                    # CHURCH MEMBERSHIP GROWTH ANALYSIS.


# Project Overview

I assumed the role of Data Analyst for my church, Lighthouse, starting in week four, focusing on tracking and analyzing membership growth. 
Our goal is to reach 200 members by the end of 2025, and we are identifying key lead and lag measures using scoreboards and data-driven insights to support strategic growth.


# Data Analysis Approach

	Weekly tracking of membership numbers.
	Identifying and analyzing lead and lag measures.
	Visualizing trends and progress over time using data analysis tools.
	Providing insights to help drive membership growth strategies.


# Initial Challenges

Since I joined in week four as a new voluntary data analyst, I couldn't analyze and visualize data from weeks one to three due to time constraints. 
However, I plan to work on these weeks at a later time to complete the dataset.


# Commitment

This project is dedicated to the growth of God's house, and I am fully committed to contributing my skills to its success. 
Through continuous data analysis and reporting, I aim to support strategic decision-making and help our church achieve its membership goals.
